						"Vrogall can use its action to polymorph into a Medium or Large humanoid it has seen or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form, except for the changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies. While in mist form, Vrogall can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage. Vrogall can only turn into a mist 3 times per day."
